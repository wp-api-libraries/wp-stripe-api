		 * Create a charge
		 *
		 * To charge a credit card, you create a Charge object. If your API key is in
		 * test mode, the supplied payment source (e.g., card) won't actually be charged,
		 * though everything else will occur as if in live mode. (Stripe assumes that the
		 * charge would have completed successfully).
		 *
		 * This function takes care of ammount, currency, and source/customer. All else
		 * are optional.
		 *
		 * @param  [type] $amount   A positive integer in the smallest currency unit (e.g.,
		 *                          100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge Â¥100, a zero-decimal
		 *                          currency) representing how much to charge the card. The
		 *                          minimum amount is $0.50 US or equivalent in charge currency.
		 * @param  string $source   A payment source to be charged, such as a credit card.
		 *                          If you also pass a customer ID, the source must be the
		 *                          ID of a source belonging to the customer (e.g., a saved
		 *                          card). Otherwise, if you do not pass a customer ID,
		 *                          the source you provide must either be a token, like
		 *                          the ones returned by Stripe.js, or a dictionary containing
		 *                          a user's credit card details, with the options described
		 *                          below. Although not all information is required, the extra
		 *                          info helps prevent fraud.
		 * @param  string $customer The ID of an existing customer that will be charged
		 *                          in this request.
		 * @param  string $currency (Default: 'usd') 3-letter ISO code for currency.
		 * @param  array  $args     (Default: array()) An array of additional arguments.
		 *                          Supports 'application_fee', 'capture', 'description',
		 *                          'destination', 'transfer_group', 'on_behalf_of', 'metadata',
		 *                          'receipt_email', 'shipping', and 'statement_descriptor'.
		 * @return object           A charge object if the charge succeeded. Returns
		 *                          an error if something goes wrong. A common source of error
		 *                          is an invalid or expired card, or a valid card with insufficient
		 *                          available balance.
		 *
		 *                          If the cvc parameter is provided, Stripe will attempt to
		 *                          check the correctness of the CVC, and the check's result
		 *                          will be returned. Similarly, if address_line1 or address_zip
		 *                          are provided, Stripe will try to check the validity of
		 *                          those parameters. Some card issuers do not support checking
		 *                          one or more of these parameters, in which case Stripe will
		 *                          return an 'unavailable' result. Also note that, depending
		 *                          on the card issuer, charges can succeed even when passed
		 *                          incorrect CVC and address information.

		 *
		 * optional:
		 *   id:
		 *     Unique string of your choice that will be used to identify this coupon
		 *     when applying it to a customer. This is often a specific code youâll
		 *     give to your customer to use when signing up (e.g., FALL25OFF). If you
		 *     donât want to specify a particular code, you can leave the ID blank
		 *     and weâll generate a random code for you.
		 *   currency:
		 *     Three-letter ISO code for the currency of the amount_off parameter
		 *     (required if amount_off is passed).
		 *   duration_in_months:
		 *     Required only if duration is repeating, in which case it must be a positive

		 *   max_redemptions:
		 *     A positive integer specifying the number of times the coupon can be

		 *                    The invoice object contains a lines hash that contains

		 *                    have been applied to the invoice, as well as any prorations
		 *                    that Stripe has automatically calculated. Each line on the

		 *                    and prorations, the amount attribute is the same as for the
		 *                    invoice item or proration respectively. For subscriptions, the
		 *                    amount may be different from the planâs regular price depending
		 *                    on whether the invoice covers a trial period or the invoice
		 *                    period differs from the planâs usual interval.
		 *
		 *                    The invoice object has both a subtotal and a total. The

		 *                    total is the final amount to be charged to the customer after
		 *                    all coupons have been applied.
		 *
		 *                    The invoice also has a next_payment_attempt attribute that
		 *                    tells you the next time (as a Unix timestamp) payment for
